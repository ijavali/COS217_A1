"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and

interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

Thinking about the state transitions was fun, but the overall assignment was very tedious and took a lot longer than I expected. Debugging the code and identifying minute differences in my program's output and the actual answer was rather unenjoyable, but the first part of coding the transitions and functions was fun.
In terms of how helpful it was, I already knew the C concepts that were being used. It was good practice for how I should write comments for later assignments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

No bugs as far as I know and have tested it. (works on all the text files provided, my decomment.c code, and other inputs I tested)
